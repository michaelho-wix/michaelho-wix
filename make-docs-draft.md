about refreshing it yourself:
 - basically i have a json file
-  which generates javascript functions locally for me
- then I submit these javascript files in a terminal
- it creates a branch in a different repository in a galaxy far far away. That branch acts as the draft docs version.
- to make larger updates you need to
  - change the json (or the javascript generated) then
  - delete the branch in the galaxy far away
- and then remake it.
