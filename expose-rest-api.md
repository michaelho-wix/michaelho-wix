## Velo examples

You can put comments in the response object like in normal JS code. meaning /**/ and // will work here.
For example:
{"purchases": [{                   /* Your Comment */
  "productId": "mid-tier",        // Your Comment
  "price": "0",
  "currency": "USD",
  "billingCycle": "YEARLY",
  "dateCreated": "2020-07-21T08:45:18Z"
}]}

## Public REST Doc preview

**WHY?** To see the doc as it will appear as a finished product to the world üôÇ

- From the internal ("bo.wix.com") doc, click on one of the articles, then the "view source" button to get into the API's repo
- Find `documentation.yaml` in your API's repo (work your way through the breadcrumbs / repo folder structure at the top of the screen, and see what files are in each folder. Normally it's kept under "proto")
- Make the title of the overall doc into a URL slug, e.g. for:

```yaml
apiDoc:
  title: Wix Blah
```
The slug will be `wix-blah`

- Add the slug into the following URL pattern:

```
https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/drafts/wix-blah?branch=wix-blah
```

**WARNING** Replace the `drafts` part of the routing with `wix-blah` when using this URL in the docs themselves.

Terminology in this doc:


# API SPEC


## General Data

**Vertical:** e.g., Wix Stores

**API Name:** e.g., Catalog


# **Description:** e.g., Wix Stores creates a catalog of store owners‚Äô items for purchase and allows store owners to create smaller collections of products by type or theme. A catalog organizes the store‚Äôs products and collections and facilitates inventory management. With the Wix Stores Catalog API you can query individual products, collections or the entire catalog, as well as create products and add their media.

**Terminology:**  	



* Catalog = a complete list of all the store‚Äôs products - compiled automatically.
* Collections = themed groupings of items for purchase that a store owner can create to organize their products (e.g., Spring 2019, Running shoes, etc.). Products can belong to multiple collections.

 \
	**Limitations:**



* Price discounts for collections apply to every item in that collection, no matter the item's price. If the coupon sets a $10 discount and there is an $8 item in that collection, that item will be free when a customer applies the coupon code.
* Coupon codes are case and space sensitive. (We recommend instructing customers to copy and paste the coupon code without making any changes.)

See [Intro Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18TDU40kPEmVxHNJ5AFNPo82DDgPv5uLIYGeOiGJFLjI/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

**Real-Life Business Scenarios:** 


    **TPA**: e.g., Coordinate a store‚Äôs inventory across other sales platforms (e.g., Facebook marketplace), or inventory management tools (e.g., NetSuite, TradeGecko).

**Use Cases:**


    **TPA**: 	1. Query Products and populate database. 


        2. Sign up for Product Created/Changed/Deleted webhooks, and periodically call Query Products and filter by `lastUpdated`. 


    3. Create/Update/Delete Products as required.


     (Note: Every call will trigger a webhook)

See [Use Case Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18TDU40kPEmVxHNJ5AFNPo82DDgPv5uLIYGeOiGJFLjI/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

**Objects/Entities:** (link to proto?)


## Data Per Endpoint/API

**User Stories** (one or more steps in the Real-Life Scenario/Use Case)



1. Whenever possible, create 1 story that fits both platforms
    1. TPAs
        1. As a TPA, I want to sync a site‚Äôs products to my platform, including inventory status.
        2. As a TPA, I want to import my products to a site owner‚Äôs store and make them available for purchase.
    2. Corvid
        3. As a Corvid Dev, I want to list all currencies for which Wix supports conversion.
        4. As a Corvid Dev, I want to convert an array of one or more amounts from one currency to another and display them to my site visitor.

**Endpoints:**

**	Request URL + params + required/optional:**

**	Response/Returns: **


    **TPA: **Is it different from the object?


    **Corvid: **Full response. For promises, what does fulfilled and rejected mean?

**	Roles & Permissions: **

**		TPA Only**

** 	Errors:**

**		Error codes and descriptions:**


    **[Guidelines](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs/rnd/platformization-guidelines/errors&sa=D&ust=1604322617619000&usg=AFQjCNHsCLCGxvPI3_ZCHagu34o_HCDjvQ)**

**	Code Sample:**

**		TPA:**


        Call in Curl with any relevant parameters


        Full JSON response


        **Corvid**: 


        	Simplest example of calling API and its return value


        	Use case using API

# Expose a rest API
1. Use [the internal REST & RPC menu editor](https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs-backstage/projects/519ba616-bc00-43a6-b7d4-c333fc87cd1e/sites/dfd344c3-ecd3-404b-8282-5486786c6cd0/menu-editor) to move the docs out of draft
1. Expose scopes to dev center
 - write in [Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvbXWI4pPVVy2_xSmB8cQRoijcLJvNl3Bbki05xB_RA/)
 - https://bo.wix.com/wow/permissions/manage-scope
3. expose webhooks to dev center
4. expose documentation
5. notify #am-tw-chat and #api-tpa-priorities
