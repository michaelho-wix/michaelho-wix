## Public REST Doc preview

**WHY?** To see the doc as it will appear as a finished product to the world ðŸ™‚

- From the internal ("bo.wix.com") doc, click on one of the articles, then the "view source" button to get into the API's repo
- Find `documentation.yaml` in your API's repo (work your way through the breadcrumbs / repo folder structure at the top of the screen, and see what files are in each folder. Normally it's kept under "proto")
- Make the title of the overall doc into a URL slug, e.g. for:

```yaml
apiDoc:
  title: Wix Blah
```
The slug will be `wix-blah`

- Add the slug into the following URL pattern:

```
https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/drafts/wix-blah?branch=wix-blah
```

**WARNING** Replace the `drafts` part of the routing with `wix-blah` when using this URL in the docs themselves.
